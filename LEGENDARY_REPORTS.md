## 🧠 8 Legendary Report Sections

### 1. 🏠 Property Snapshot
**Estated Data + Claude AI Translation**

Instead of raw data, get a conversational summary:

> *"This is a 3-bedroom, 2-bath single-family residence built in 1971, spanning 1,450 sq ft on a 5,800 sq ft lot, zoned R1. Here's what makes this interesting for investors: the property sits in a mature neighborhood with established infrastructure, offering both rental income potential and light flip opportunities due to its solid bones and desirable lot size."*

**What you get:**
- Full address, parcel ID, APN
- Structure type, year built, square footage
- Beds, baths, parking, stories
- Zoning, land use code
- **AI summary that highlights investment appeal**

### 2. 👤 Ownership & Off-Market Potential
**Estated Data + AI Motivation Analysis**

We don't just tell you who owns it – we analyze **why they might sell**:

> *"This property is owned by an absentee landlord who purchased it 22 years ago for $85,000. The owner lives 200 miles away and likely has $247,000 in equity. Consider a direct mail approach highlighting equity capture and portfolio simplification – motivation score: 8/10."*

**What you get:**
- Owner name and mailing address
- Absentee owner detection
- Ownership duration analysis
- **Motivation to sell scoring (1-10)**
- **Specific outreach strategy recommendations**

### 3. 💰 Valuation & Equity Deep Dive
**Estated Data + AI Financial Analysis**

Beyond basic valuations, get insider financial perspective:

> *"The property has an estimated $247,000 in equity based on its 2002 purchase and current AVM of $332,000. The tax-assessed value lags significantly at $180,000, suggesting potential for increased property tax reassessment post-purchase. This creates both opportunity (motivated seller) and risk (higher carrying costs)."*

**What you get:**
- AVM (automated valuation model)
- Last sale price + date
- Property tax value + amount
- **AI equity calculations**
- **Tax reassessment risk analysis**

### 4. 📈 Deal Strategy Scorecard
**Pure AI Analysis**

Get specific strategy recommendations with reasoning:

| Strategy | Fit | AI Reasoning |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| **Flip** | ✅ B+ | *Needs light updates, good spread potential* |
| **BRRRR** | ✅ A- | *Strong rental demand area, solid refinance potential* |
| **Wholesale** | ❌ C | *Low margin opportunity, better to hold* |

> *"Best suited for buy-and-hold or BRRRR investors. Home is rentable as-is with light cosmetic rehab, located in a strong rental-demand ZIP. The 22-year ownership suggests the seller may be motivated by portfolio changes."*

### 5. 📍 Location & Environmental Context
**Estated Data + AI Market Intelligence**

Inferred insights based on location characteristics:

> *"The 11432 area represents a transitioning Queens neighborhood with improving walkability (Medium) and decent transit access via subway connections. School zones are average but improving. Investor trend: 14% YoY appreciation in entry-level homes driven by NYC proximity and affordability gap."*

**What you get:**
- City, ZIP, County details
- **Walkability assessment (Low/Med/High)**
- **Transit access likelihood**
- **School zone quality estimate**
- **Local investor market trends**

### 6. ⚠️ Red Flags & Deal Killers
**AI Risk Assessment**

Get warned about deal-killers before you waste time:

> *"CAUTION: This home hasn't sold in over 20 years, but the assessed value is extremely low, possibly triggering a reassessment post-transfer. Check local reassessment policies. Additionally, pre-1980 construction may require lead paint and asbestos considerations."*

**Risk categories analyzed:**
- Property age issues (>60 years flagged)
- Tax reassessment triggers
- Absentee owner maintenance risks
- Structural/environmental concerns
- **Overall risk scoring with specific warnings**

### 7. 📜 AI Investor Whisper Summary
**Your Virtual Mentor**

Get the insider perspective you'd pay thousands for:

> *"Listen, if you're looking for a stable BRRRR play, this 3-bed home in a family-friendly ZIP is worth pursuing. The owner has strong equity and doesn't live at the property – classic motivated seller setup. I'd approach with a soft offer at 75% of AVM minus rehab costs. My gut says this owner is ready to cash out if you present it right."*

**What you get:**
- **Conversational mentor-style summary**
- **Target buyer identification**
